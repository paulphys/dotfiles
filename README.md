All configuration files for my terminal-and-vim-based Artix Linux environment

paul@art
----------------- 
OS: Artix Linux (OpenRC)
Host: XPS 15 9560
Kernel: 5.15.8
Shell: zsh 5.8
WM: dwm 
Terminal: st
```

- Very useful scripts are in `~/.local/bin/`
- Settings for:
	- vim/nvim (text editor)
	- zsh (shell)
	- lf (file manager)
	- zathura (pdf viewer)
	- mpd/ncmpcpp (music)
	- sxiv (image/gif viewer)
	- mpv (video player)
	- obsidian (note-taking)
- I try to minimize what's directly in `~` so:
	- All configs that can be in `~/.config/` are.

## Custom builds
- [dwm](https://github.com/paulphys/dwm) (window manager)
- [dwmblocks](https://github.com/paulphys/dwmblocks) (statusbar)
